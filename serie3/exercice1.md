# exercice 1
* Show that 2 is a primitive element for GF(5)
but not for GF(7)

primitive (q − 1)th root of unity in GF(q) :<br>
z^n = 1


Z5 = {1,2,3,4}<br>
Z*n = {a£ Zn : gcd(a,n) = 1}

2² == 4 mod 5 => 4 = 5-1

2² == 4 mod 7 => 4 != 7-1


* Show that 3 is a primitive element for GF(7)

3³ ==  27 mod 7 => 6 = 7-1
